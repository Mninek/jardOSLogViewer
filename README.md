# jardOSLogViewer

Log viewer (more like log converter) built with the jardOS in mind.

I decided to build this so that when I have larger logs I can organize them exactly how I would want.

Currently the log viewer converts the .log file to a .html file that is color coded based on the log type

To run, I just need to execute: "python3 ../jardOSLogViewer/LogViewer.py debug.log"
